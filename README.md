# Nlp-implementation-model-training-for-spam-classification

## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to build a Spam Classification system. The project focuses on classifying messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms.



## Steps Involved

### Data Loading and Exploration:
The dataset is loaded, and its encoding is detected and handled.
Initial exploration includes checking for null values, renaming columns, and visualizing the distribution of spam and ham messages.

### Feature Engineering:
Handling imbalanced dataset using oversampling.
Creating new features such as word_count, contains_currency_symbol, and contains_numbers.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualization of word_count distribution for spam and ham messages.
Analysis of messages containing currency symbols and numbers.

### Data Cleaning:
Removing special characters and numbers using regular expressions.
Converting the entire text to lowercase.
Tokenizing the text by words.
Removing stop words.
Lemmatizing the words.

### Creating the Bag of Words model:
Using TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert the text data into numerical vectors.

### Model Building & Evaluation:
Evaluation metric: F1-Score.
Training and evaluating various models, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and a Voting Classifier.

### Selection of Final Model:
Choosing Random Forest as the final model based on F1-Score.

### Making Predictions:
Implementing a function to predict whether a given message is spam or ham.

### Introduction of Stacked LSTM Model:
Implementation of a stacked LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.





## Tools/Technologies Required

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the process of building a spam classification system. By combining exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, the model achieved high F1-Score, especially with the Random Forest algorithm. The LSTM model introduces a deep learning approach, adding flexibility for further experimentation.






## Potential Improvements
### Hyperparameter Tuning:
Perform more thorough hyperparameter tuning for machine learning and LSTM models to enhance performance.

### Ensemble Techniques:
Explore additional ensemble techniques or stacking methods to boost model performance.

### Deep Learning Architectures:
Experiment with different LSTM architectures or try other deep learning models like GRU or Bidirectional LSTM.

### Web Application Integration:
Develop a web application for users to interact with the spam classification system in real-time.

### Deployment:
Deploy the final model as a web service or integrate it into existing systems for broader usage.

### Handling New Data:
Implement a mechanism to handle new incoming data and continuously update and retrain the model.
